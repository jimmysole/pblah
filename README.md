# p-blah

p-blah is a simple, yet powerful forum/social management system. Features include but are not limited to, forums, creating groups, live chat, uploading files, creating profiles and more.


p-blah is still under active development and should not be considered ready for widespread use. More features will be added or changed as bugs and or new ideas come to mind. However, I would appreciate any testing of the existing code base.
