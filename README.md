# p-blah

p-blah is a simple, yet powerful forum/social management system. Features include but are not limited to, forums, creating groups, live chat, uploading files, creating profiles and more.


p-blah is still under active development and should not be considered ready for widespread use, although the features work, more will be added or changed. However, I would appreciate any testing of the existing code base.
